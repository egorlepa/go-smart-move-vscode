# Go Smart Move

**Go Smart Move** is a VS Code extension designed to streamline Go development by automatically handling the refactoring of Go package names during file moves and creation.

## Features
- **Automatic Package Name Update**: When you move a Go file between packages, the extension detects the change and automatically updates the `package` declaration to reflect the new package name.
- **New File Package Setup**: For new Go files, it automatically sets the `package` declaration based on the file's directory, ensuring consistency from the start.
- **Simplified Refactoring**: This extension helps eliminate manual updates to package names, reducing the chance for errors and improving workflow efficiency.

With **Go Smart Move**, you'll keep your Go codebase organized and maintainable with minimal effort when renaming files or creating new ones.
